</div></p>
<h2>What is cross-posting?</h2>
<p>Cross-posting is the process of posting similar content across multiple social media channels. Social media managers use the tactic to help save time and resources. No more crafting a unique social media update for each channel every time you need to post.</p>
<p>Alongside saving time, cross-posting is a highly effective tactic for social managers to use because it helps streamline your posting strategy, gives you an opportunity to repurpose content across multiple platforms, and continually keeps your social channels up to date.</p>
<p>Crossposting is also beneficial if you’re looking to increase brand awareness because it’s an opportunity to get your message shared on various channels where it has a higher chance of being seen by your target audience. And with the average US citizen spending an <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/">average of two hours</a> on social media, crossposting is an effective way to get more eyes on your content and message.</p>
<h3>Who is crossposting good for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Companies with smaller budgets</li>
<li>Startups and founders who are running social alongside doing everything else</li>
<li>New brands that haven’t developed a lot of content yet</li>
<li>Time-conscious creators who want to free up hours to spend on delivering engaging, compelling posts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is there a cross-posting app?</h2>
<p>Yes! Hootsuite’s Composer comes with a <a href="https://help.hootsuite.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260804305949-Create-and-publish-posts#create-your-post-0-3">built-in feature</a> that allows you to customize one post for multiple social networks, all on the same interface. This means you won’t have to start from scratch each time you want to compose a social media post.</p>

<h2>How to cross-post on social media without looking spammy</h2>
<p>Cross-posting sounds simple: you’re sharing your content on different networks. How tricky can it be? But, there are essential caveats to the cross-posting process that marketers need to understand.</p>
<p>Posting the exact same message to every network without editing it for the specific requirements and audience demands of those networks can make you look amateur or robotic at best and untrustworthy at worst.</p>
<h3>Learn how to speak multiple networks</h3>
<p>Every social media platform is different. For example, Pinterest is awash with Pins, Twitter is full of Tweets, and Instagram is packed with Stories. So when you’re crossposting, you need to be mindful of the differences between each social media platform and learn how to speak their language.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re the newest coffee shop on the block and want to create a social post to reach your audience on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Each of these social networks has a unique set of parameters for posting, and your cross-posting strategy needs to take these into account.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/twitter-marketing/">character limit</a> on Twitter is 280, whereas the limit on Facebook is <a href="https://help.hootsuite.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260804306269-Hootsuite-product-limits-and-recommendations#compose-and-publish-posts-0-4">2,000</a>, and <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-marketing/">Instagram</a> is 2,200, so make sure that you tailor your cross-posted content to fit these lengths.</p>
<p>Suppose you plan on adding images and videos to your social media marketing (and we think you should!). You’ll need to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-image-sizes-guide/">image sizes for each channel</a> and consider whether any accounts you plan on tagging in your posts are active on that channel.</p>
<p>For example, there’s no point using a handle tag for a brand on Twitter, cross-posting that post to Instagram, and realizing they don’t have an account on that platform.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick list of other parameters you’ll need to take into account when you’re crafting your content to cross-post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clickable links</li>
<li>Hashtag usage</li>
<li>Vocabulary</li>
<li>Audience</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>CTA</li>
</ul>
<h3>Schedule posts in advance</h3>
<p>Timing on social media is everything. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-twitter-instagram/">best times to post</a> for each platform and schedule your posts for maximum impact using a social media management tool (like Hootsuite, *hint hint*).</p>
<p>Not only does Hootsuite’s Composer come with a built-in feature that tells you the best time to publish social content on your channels, but, as we mentioned above, it also allows you to customize one post for multiple social networks. You can also bulk schedule social media posts, saving you even more time.</p>

<h3>Consider the “one and done” rule</h3>
<p>You know that guy who tells the same story at every party, and everyone tunes out as soon as he starts talking? That’s how your audience feels when you repeat content — like they’d rather be elsewhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/post-to-all-social-media-at-once/">Don’t post the exact same message</a> across multiple platforms. Not only do you run the risk of your audience seeing a repeated post and getting bored or frustrated at repetition, your <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-marketing-plan/">social media strategy</a> will come across as dull and flat.</p>
<p>Sharing the exact same post on all your channels means you might accidentally end up inviting your followers to retweet you on Facebook or Pin your post on Instagram. You may also lose part of your caption, or tag a handle from one platform that doesn’t exist on another or lose your visual content.</p>
<p>For example, Instagram lets you link your profile to your other social media accounts and automatically share each post (along with its caption and hashtags) to all of them.</p>
<p>However, these posts don’t always turn out the way you want them to. Instagram posts shared to Twitter include a link to the photo, but not the photo itself.</p>
<p>As a result, you miss out on the engagement a <a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/video-is-increasingly-important-in-content-marketing-infographic/">visual would generate</a>, and maybe part of your caption too. The result is a hasty-looking post that won’t impress your followers or inspire them to click.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-303448" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-48.png" /></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-303456" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-49.png" /></p>
<p>If you’re short-changing your followers on one platform by sharing content optimized for another, they’re going to notice. Seeing a post with a cut-off caption or a weirdly cropped image looks lazy at best and spammy at worst.</p>
<p>The time you save by cross-posting isn’t worth losing your audience’s respect and attention. After all, if it looks like you don’t care about what you post on your account, why should they? <div class="content-upgrade content-upgrade--popup-variant content-upgrade--is-hidden _popupVariantContentUpgrade"><div class="content-upgrade__popup-header">

<h3>Stay on the right side of the social media tracks</h3>
<p>Just like there’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M8szlSa-8o">no crying in baseball</a>, there’s no corner-cutting on social media. Your followers aren’t the only ones who’ll notice when you repost the same content; the platforms are catching on too.</p>
<p>Twitter is one primary channel that’s <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/twitter-automation-changes/">limited automation</a> and identical content as part of its effort to curb bots and spam accounts.</p>
<p>Repeating content can result in more than disengaged followers: your account could get suspended. Instead, stay on the right side of anti-spam rules by taking the time to ensure each message you post is thoughtful and deliberate.</p>
<h3>Get creative, show your social flair</h3>
<p>Cross-posting is a great way to flex creative muscles and craft dynamic content that sets you apart from your competition. For example, lengthening captions and copy, adding or removing hashtags, and formatting images to match the needs of your audience.</p>
<p>When you’re letting creative juices run wild, It’s essential to keep top of mind that different demographics hang out on different platforms. For example, on a global scale, LinkedIn’s users are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/933964/distribution-of-users-on-linkedin-worldwide-gender/">57% male and 43% female</a>, with most of their <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-demographics-for-business/">audience over 30</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Instagram has more women than men, and <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-demographics/">their biggest demographic</a> are those under 30. As a result, the people who engage with your content on LinkedIn will likely favor an entirely different post than those on Instagram.</p>
<p>Eyewear brand Warby Parker is great at adjusting its content to make sure it looks perfect on each account. For example, a post about their Fort Worth, Texas store getting a new mural was shared as a photo on Twitter. But on Instagram, they took advantage of the option to combine multiple videos or photos into a single post.</p>
<p>Instead of sharing just the “after” photo, they included a video of the mural in progress and invited audiences to swipe to see the final result.</p>

<p>Even small edits can make the difference between a post that looks sloppy and one that shines. For example, Moe the Corgi doesn’t have a Twitter handle, but he has an Instagram account. If Warby Parker had copied their caption from Instagram, there would be a dead-end handle in the middle of their adorable tweet.</p>

<h2><a id="post-303261-_y1pn2p67ffhy"></a>What is conversational AI?</h2>
<p>The term Conversational AI (artificial intelligence) refers to technologies, like virtual assistants or chatbots, that can “talk” to people (e.g., answer questions).</p>
<p>Conversational AI tools function thanks to processes such as machine learning, automated responses, and natural language processing. The goal is for them to recognize language and communication, imitate them, and create the experience of human interaction.</p>
<p>Conversational AI applications are often used in customer service. They can be found on websites, online stores, and social media channels. AI technology can effectively speed up and streamline answering and routing customer inquiries.</p>
<h2><a id="post-303261-_4re307emser2"></a>How does conversational AI work?</h2>
<p>Conversational AI primarily works thanks to two functions. The first is <strong>machine learning</strong>. To put it simply, machine learning means that the technology “learns” and improves the more it’s used. It collects information from its own interactions. It then uses that information to improve on itself as time goes by.</p>
<p>The result is a system that will work better six months after you add it to your page and even better than that a year down the line.</p>
<p>The second is called <strong>natural language processing</strong>, or NLP for short. This is the process through which artificial intelligence understands language. Once it learns to recognize words and phrases, it can move on to <strong>natural language generation</strong>. This is the process through which it converses with your customers.</p>
<p>Natural language generation basically means that the AI simulates conversation. For example, if a customer messages you on social media, asking for information on when an order will ship, the AI chatbot will know how to respond. It will do so based on prior experience answering similar questions and because it understands which phrases tend to work best in response to shipping questions.</p>
<p>The theory may sound grueling, but conversational AI chatbots make for a very smooth customer experience. Here’s an example of how you can expect it to look in action:</p>
<figure id="attachment_303344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303344" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-Heyday-001.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-303344 size-full" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-Heyday-001.png" alt="Screenshot of chat with an AI chatbot on Messenger" width="279" height="551" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303344" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/heyday"><em>Heyday</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<h2><a id="post-303261-_fg2txapuivuz"></a>The benefits of using conversational AI tools</h2>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_7e8zg09jbc3x"></a>Save time</h3>
<p>In an ideal world, every one of your customers would get a thorough customer service experience. But the reality is that some customers are going to come to you with inquiries far simpler than others. A chatbot or virtual assistant is a great way to ensure everyone’s needs are attended to without overextending yourself and your team.</p>
<p>AI chatbots can take care of straightforward customer service issues and allow you and your team to deal with the more complex ones. It also decreases wait times on both ends. Our very own chatbot, <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/heyday">Heyday by Hootsuite</a>, helps businesses automate as much as 80% of all customer service conversations!</p>
<figure id="attachment_303352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303352" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-Conversational-AI.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-303352" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-Conversational-AI.png" alt="Order tracking in Heyday" width="350" height="598" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-Conversational-AI.png 608w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-Conversational-AI-310x529.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303352" class="wp-caption-text"><em><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/heyday">Heyday</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Conversational AI can handle multiple claims at once where you and your team can’t. It makes for a far more efficient customer service system.</p>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_ar9smztn6lxy"></a>Increased accessibility</h3>
<p>You can’t be available to your customers around the clock seven days a week. Equipping your social media platform with Conversational AI solves this problem. If a customer needs help outside of regular business hours, a chatbot can attend to their issues. It solves a logistic problem and plays into how chatbots can save time, but there’s more to it than that.</p>
<p>Conversational AI can make your customers feel more cared for and at ease, given how they increase your accessibility. The reality is that midnight might be the only free time someone has to get their question answered or issue attended to. With an AI tool like Heyday, getting an answer to a shipping inquiry is a matter of seconds:</p>
<figure id="attachment_303360" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303360" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-3.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-303360 size-large" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-3-620x477.png" alt="order tracking with Heyday" width="620" height="477" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-3-620x477.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-3-310x238.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-3.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303360" class="wp-caption-text"><em><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/heyday">Heyday</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While not every problem can be solved via a virtual assistant, conversational AI means that customers like these can get the help they need.</p>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_lagmler3nayu"></a>Help your customers make purchasing decisions</h3>
<p>Conversational AI can help solve customer support tickets, sure. But it can also assist in making and modifying sales.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of machine learning is its ability to create a personalized experience for your customers. This means that a Conversational AI platform can make product or add-on recommendations to customers that they might not have seen or considered.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of what these recommendations look like in action:</p>
<figure id="attachment_303368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303368" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-5.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-303368 size-large" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-5-620x477.png" alt="Conversational AI recommending products in Heyday chat" width="620" height="477" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-5-620x477.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-5-310x238.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-5.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303368" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/heyday"><em>Heyday</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Conversational AI solutions like Heyday make these recommendations based on what’s in the customer’s cart and their purchase inquiries (e.g., the category they’re interested in).</p>
<p>The result? More sales without you having to lift a finger.</p>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_bjgqzjjlevjm"></a>Sell outside of business hours</h3>
<p>Speaking of assisting customers in making purchase decisions, another benefit of Conversational AI comes back to the accessibility it offers. One of the great upsides to running a business online is the fact that sales can occur at any time. The only thing that can interfere with that are the sort of shipping, sales, or product inquiries customers might have when there aren’t representatives available.</p>
<p>A chatbot or virtual assistant fixes this easily. Because it’s available at all hours, it can assist anybody waiting to get a question answered before completing their checkout. It means those sales come faster &#8211; and that you don’t run the risk of customers losing interest in their purchase before completing it.</p>
<p>With Heyday, you can even set your chatbot up to include “Add to cart” calls to action and seamlessly direct your customers to checkout.</p>
<figure id="attachment_303376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303376" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-conversational-AI-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-303376" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-conversational-AI-2-620x789.png" alt="Shopping prompts within Heyday chat" width="550" height="700" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-conversational-AI-2-620x789.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-conversational-AI-2-310x395.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-conversational-AI-2-768x977.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heyday-conversational-AI-2.png 792w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303376" class="wp-caption-text"><em><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/heyday">Heyday</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_syx4idopfgt"></a>No more language barriers</h3>
<p>An underrated aspect of Conversational AI is that it eliminates language barriers. Most chatbots and virtual assistants come with language translation software. This allows them to detect, interpret, and generate almost any language proficiently.</p>
<p>The result is that no customer service interaction is held back by linguistic differences. It makes your business more welcoming and accessible to a wider variety of customers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_303384" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303384" style="width: 258px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-4.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-303384 size-full" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversational-AI-heyday-4.png" alt="Language detection within Heyday chat" width="258" height="512" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303384" class="wp-caption-text"><em><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/heyday">Heyday</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><a id="post-303261-_8ck5s83o9188"></a>Conversational AI best practices</h2>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_xl9fohn6s4ic"></a>Know when to get (human) customer service agents involved</h3>
<p>An artificial intelligence tool is great for solving simple problems. But it’s good to know their limits. Not every customer is going to have an issue that conversational AI can handle. Chatbots are assistants to your customer service team — not a replacement. Make sure you have agents on standby, ready to jump in when a more complex inquiry comes in.</p>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_9uvk6vfmo2ma"></a>Optimize for social commerce</h3>
<p>You want to get the most out of your Conversational AI. You also want to make sure your customers have as much access to the help they need as possible. The best way to accomplish both of these things is to choose a conversational AI tool optimized for social commerce.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heyday.ai/">Heyday</a> is a tool design with the specific needs of retailers in mind. It integrates with ecommerce, shipping and marketing tools, seamlessly connecting the back-end of your business with your customers — and helping you create the best customer experience possible.</p>

<ul>

<li>Magento</li>
<li>PrestaShop</li>

<h3><a id="post-303261-_i9d5mx7zm71n"></a><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-44.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-303318" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-44.png" alt="Amazon's AI-powered chatbot" width="600" height="692" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-44.png 1036w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-44-310x357.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-44-620x715.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-44-768x885.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></h3>
<p>They may not be a social media platform, but it’s never a bad idea to take notes from the biggest online retailer in the world.</p>
<p>Amazon uses a virtual assistant as its first line of customer service. The Amazon experience is largely driven by prompted questions, like in the example above. It also incorporates data on recent orders to get information on what the customers may be interested in.</p>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_k4hnvzw93wus"></a>DAVIDsTEA</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-45.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-303326" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-45.png" alt="DavidsTea's Heyday chatbot interaction" width="600" height="984" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-45.png 840w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-45-310x509.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-45-620x1017.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-45-768x1260.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>DAVIDsTEA uses Heyday for social customer service. This Canadian specialty tea company takes a more language-oriented approach. Their chatbot uses common speech patterns to provide customers with the answers and information they need.</p>
<h3><a id="post-303261-_3hkui5h2eikf"></a>Clocks and Colours</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-46.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-303334" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-46.png" alt="Chatbot on Facebook Messenger" width="600" height="735" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-46.png 648w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-46-310x380.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/word-image-46-620x760.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Jewelry brand Clocks and Colours uses a chatbot on their Facebook Page. When someone reaches out, the brand’s virtual assistant is triggered. Like Amazon’s bot, this one too services the brand’s customers through prompted questioning and light language generation.</p>
<p>Clocks and Colours’ bot is integrated with the brand’s traditional customer service channels. When a user indicates they want to chat with an agent, the AI will alert a customer service representative. If nobody is available, a custom “away” message is sent, and the inquiry is added to the customer service team’s queue.</p>

<h2><strong>What is social media analytics?</strong></h2>
<p>Social media analytics is the collection and analysis of data points that help you measure the performance of your social media accounts.</p>
<p>These are the metrics that will help you assess your social media marketing strategy on both macro and micro levels. Besides helping you see how social media is contributing to your larger business goals, they can also help you gauge customer sentiment, spot trends, and avoid PR crises before they happen.</p>
<p>To track social media analytics, you’ll look at likes, comments, shares and saves, but you might also monitor mentions and discussion of your brand or consumer insights by practising <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-listening-business/">social listening</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-analytics/">Social media analytics</a> tools help you do all this math, while also creating performance reports to share with your team, stakeholders, and boss — to figure out where you’re succeeding and where you’re struggling.</p>
<h2><strong>How to track social media analytics</strong></h2>
<p>It may seem like a daunting task, but tracking your social media analytics isn’t difficult. It just requires a little bit of planning and a lot of consistency. You’ve got this!</p>
<p>We’ve even made a template for you to plug your social media analytics report into at the end of this post.</p>
<h3><strong>Set S.M.A.R.T. Goals</strong></h3>
<p>It’s pretty much impossible to measure your success if you don’t actually know what success looks like. So great social media tracking begins with setting a goal for your brand.</p>
<p>To be clear: a social media goal is not the same thing as <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-marketing-plan/">a social media strategy</a> (although both are important).</p>
<p>A social media goal is a statement about something specific you want to achieve with your marketing activity. Your goal can be applied to something short-term and small (for instance, a single ad buy) or can be bigger picture (like a goal for your overall social media campaign).</p>
<p>Either way, we recommend using the S.M.A.R.T. framework for your social media goals to set yourself up for maximum success.</p>
<p>S.M.A.R.T. stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific: </strong>Your goal should be as precise as possible. What exactly do you want to achieve? “Improve our Instagram account” is too vague. “<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-engagement/">Build Instagram engagement</a> by 500%” is far clearer.</li>
<li><strong>Measurable: </strong>Set some quantifiable indicators (a.k.a. hard numbers) to make success clear. For instance, “<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-get-tiktok-followers/">increase our TikTok followers</a> by 1,000 this month.” Without having a goal that’s measurable, you’ll never know if you’ve achieved it.</li>
<li><strong>Attainable: </strong>Listen, it’s great to want to reach for the stars, but setting the bar a little lower is going to make it much more likely that you’ll actually achieve it. Think baby steps here. If your goal is to push a million views to your website this week, but you just launched it yesterday, you’re only setting yourself up for failure.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant: </strong>How does this goal fit into your overall plan? Go ahead and strive to get Rhianna to follow you back on Twitter, but make sure it’s clear <em>why </em>pursuing that goal is going to benefit your big-picture brand strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Deadlines are key. When do you want to achieve your goal? If you can’t come up with a timeline, that might be an indicator that your goal just isn’t specific or attainable enough.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/smart-social-media-goals/">Here are some suggestions for social media goals</a>, if you need a place to start. Once you’ve got one in place, it’s time to figure out just how to best measure your progress towards that goal. Which leads us to…</p>
<h3><strong>Decide which metrics matter to you most</strong></h3>
<p>There are a lot of different numbers flying around the social-media-verse. Likes! Followers! Views! Shares! Duets!(?) How do you know which of these <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-metrics/">social media metrics</a> are important? Well… it’s really up to you.</p>
<figure id="attachment_303205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303205" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.53.54-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-303205 size-full" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.53.54-AM.png" alt="social media metrics audience reach" width="586" height="1026" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.53.54-AM.png 586w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.53.54-AM-310x543.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303205" class="wp-caption-text">Instagram Analytics</figcaption></figure>
<p>Remember that goal you set, just moments ago in step number one? (We really hope you remember, it <em>just happened</em>.)</p>
<p>That’s going to determine which metrics actually matter because you want to keep an eye on the data that will help you measure your progress towards your goal.</p>
<p>Social media metrics fall into one of four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> current and potential audience.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement: </strong>how audiences are interacting with your content.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion: </strong>effectiveness of your social engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer:</strong> how active customers think and feel about your brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your goal is to grow your Instagram following, then metrics that track engagement (like follows and likes) are probably the most important ones to keep an eye on. If your goal is sales, conversion-related metrics are more relevant (that might include views or click-through rates).</p>
<figure id="attachment_303213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303213" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.54.00-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-303213 size-large" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.54.00-AM-620x259.png" alt="report of performance growth including brand awareness audience growth and engagement rate " width="620" height="259" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.54.00-AM-620x259.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.54.00-AM-310x129.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.54.00-AM-768x320.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.54.00-AM-1536x641.png 1536w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.54.00-AM.png 1582w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303213" class="wp-caption-text">A social media analytics report in Hootsuite Analytics</figcaption></figure>
<p>Not all metrics are equally important for every goal, so save yourself a headache by tracking the numbers that actually matter.</p>
<h3><strong>Check in regularly </strong></h3>
<p>Importantly, social media analytics shouldn’t just be used for “before and after” snapshots of your goal’s impact. Check in regularly on your analytics over the course of a campaign or project with <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-report-template-guide/">social media reports</a> to ensure you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>“What can’t be measured, can’t be managed,” as the old leadership adage goes. If you just set your strategy and let it play out without any observation, you’re missing opportunities to adjust and adapt along the way.</p>
<p>All the major social media accounts have their own in-platform analytics tools. In fact, here’s a list of step-by-step guides to using the Insights tools for pretty much every social platform you can dream of:</p>
<ul>

<h3><strong>Pay attention to spikes and drops</strong></h3>
<p>Once you’ve got your piping hot report in your hands, it’s time to analyze these analytics. Social media metrics offer a clue as to what’s going on out there on the world wide web: it’s up to you to interpret what they actually mean.</p>
<p>Look for any spikes and drops in your numbers, and then dig into why those anomalies happened.</p>
<p>Were you running a new, experimental campaign that inspired a ton of comments? Did your product have an unflattering portrayal in a hit television show that turned customers off? You might discover information that helps you either replicate those highs, or avoid another low.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.59.25-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-303229" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.59.25-AM-620x1073.png" alt="Instagram engagement graph of profile views and likes" width="620" height="1073" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.59.25-AM-620x1073.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.59.25-AM-310x537.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-10.59.25-AM.png 632w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>As you <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-sentiment-analysis-tools/">monitor social sentiment</a> over time, you’ll start to understand how your messaging can influence the way your followers feel about you (for better or for worse!).

<h3><strong>Use the right tools</strong></h3>
<p>Technology is your friend when it comes to social media analytics, and there are dozens of tools out there to help make sense of the numbers.</p>
<p>The right social media analytics tools can help you answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do my followers comment more on photo posts or text posts?</li>
<li>Which social media network drove the most traffic to our website this month?</li>
<li>Should we post more on TikTok next quarter?</li>

<h2>What is a TikTok trend?</h2>
<p>A TikTok trend can be a sound, hashtag, dance or challenge. Even how you edit your post can become a trend (like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yoleendadong/video/7032056521722793221?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=transitiontrend&amp;t=1639471026541">this swanky transition type</a>). Once a trend starts to gain traction, users “hop on” it by recreating a trending TikTok video or theme.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/2020-s-stars-and-trends-look-how-far-theyve-come">According to TikTok</a>, some of the top trends of 2021 were whipped coffee and a quick and easy skincare routine, while niche communities that spiked in 2021 included <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=witchtok&amp;t=1639474120537">Witchtok</a> (20 billion views) and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=arttiktok&amp;t=1639474139663">ArtTikTok</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=tiktokart&amp;t=1639474209538">TikTokArt</a> (11 billion views).</p>
<p>Is there a difference between TikTok trends for creators and TikTok trends for businesses? In short, no. Any trend is fair game for any user of the app, and often businesses and entrepreneurs successfully adapt trends made by creators.</p>
<h2>Why are TikTok trends good for marketing?</h2>
<p>I know what you’re thinking. Something like: <em>I’m a faithful reader of the Hootsuite Blog, and I know that being genuine, unique and finding my niche are essential building blocks for successful marketing. So how does doing something that everyone else is doing help me?</em></p>
<p>Hopping on a trend (and putting your own spin on it!) is an accessible strategy for creating content that immediately resonates with people. Trends are instantly recognizable, like the first three notes of Britney Spears’ “Hit Me Baby One More Time.” And ultimately, that recognition can <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-make-money-on-tiktok-4-easy-strategies/">make you money</a>.</p>
<h3>Trends were made to be modified</h3>
<p>Scrolling through the app, you’ll notice that while TikTok trends are always identifiable, not all videos within a trend are the same (that would make for a very boring feed).</p>
<p>Users putting their own spin on trends is the best part — and they often get rewarded (by the algorithm) for breaking conventions. For example, this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joshbeauchamp/video/7036030109270363438?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">ring light “Infinity” trend</a> became a hotbed of thirst traps, but some of the greatest videos are made by users who don’t even have a ring light.</p>

<h3>Advertising on TikTok is hotter than ever</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/pages/digital-trends-2021">Hootsuite’s 2022 Digital Trends Report</a>, the average amount of time an internet user aged 16 to 64 spends on social media is 2 hours and 27 minutes. That’s a lot of time to be advertised to.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/6-takeaways-from-our-latest-kantar-study">Kantar says</a> that TikTok ads are more enjoyable than ads on other platforms. In fact, much of that positivity has to do with trendsetting.</p>
<p>21% of people surveyed by Kantar said that ads on TikTok were more trendsetting than ads on other platforms, and businesses can capitalize on that by hopping on the trends. The more seamlessly your ad fits into the rest of the person’s feed, the less likely they’ll be to get annoyed and skip it, and using trends in ads is a surefire way to blend in.</p>

<h2>14 of the most important TikTok trends of 2022</h2>
<p>Because of the fleeting nature of TikTok trends, it’s difficult to pin down specific trends that will be popular in 2022. But don’t worry, we’ve still got you covered: this list covers the hottest general trends as well as tips for identifying current trends.</p>
<p>So read on, get inspired and adapt these trends into a solid <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-marketing/">TikTok marketing strategy</a>!</p>
<h3>1. Trending dances</h3>
<p>TikTok is known for creators who know their moves — and in fact, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-make-money-on-tiktok-4-easy-strategies/">many of the highest-earning TikTokkers are dancers</a>.</p>
<p>But thanks to trending dances, you don’t have to be a professional to execute the perfect choreography. TikTok dances are usually short, sweet and entry-level, so amateurs can learn them with little practice. This leaves a lot of room for putting your own spin on it—for example, tearing up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p>

<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>A quick scroll through the app will show you what dances are trending now, but you can also look up the hashtags <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=dancechallenge&amp;t=1639251678908">#dancechallenge</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=dancetrend&amp;t=1639251235411">#dancetrend</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=trendingdance&amp;t=1639251213225">#trendingdance</a> to find what’s popular.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a dance you like, tap on the sound to see other interpretations of the dance — you might even find <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bizzyboom/video/7027218752982895877?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=do%20it%20to%20it%20dance%20challenge%20tutorial&amp;t=1639251626659">a tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Edgy humor</h3>
<p>There’s a reason why <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-stats/#TikTok_user_statistics">TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd</a>: the short videos and highly scrollable nature of the app make it perfect for humor, snark and sass. And while many content creators and savvy social media marketers have found ways to turn TikTok into a business, the platform’s main mission is to “inspire creativity and create joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. In fact, the edgier, the better.</p>
<p>We like to engage in some edgy humor ourselves on Hootsuite’s TikTok account:</p>

<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<h3>3. Glow-ups</h3>
<p>At its core, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many creators will post a few photos or videos of themselves as an awkward teen, then a final, current clip. (Usually, one where they look confident and awesome).</p>
<p>These types of TikToks are great for the wait-for-it factor: users are more likely to watch the whole video to see the end result.</p>
<p>Glow-ups also work great for generating positive engagement. This example is at 716 thousand likes (and counting!).</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@xoxoemira/video/7018969339768360197" data-video-id="7018969339768360197" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" >

</blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>But glow-ups don’t always have to be about the teen-to-adult transformation. You can make a glow-up about <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thisartperson/video/6961483574306409734?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=artglowup&amp;t=1639374407477">your art</a>, your <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@homewithmila/video/6926636398644694278?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=home%20glow%20up&amp;t=1639375107794">home renovation</a> or your <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drewxcarrington/video/7006427101054209286?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=business%20glow%20up&amp;t=1639375210507">small (but growing) business</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Seamless transitions</h3>
<p>Another element that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions within videos. The in-app editing tools make it easy to switch from one clip to another in a way that looks like magic.</p>
<p>This can be as simple as keeping your lighting the same and keeping your camera in the same spot, as in the example below:</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@thefashioncouple/video/6948533999878819077" data-video-id="6948533999878819077" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" >
<section> <a target="_blank" title="@thefashioncouple" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thefashioncouple">@thefashioncouple</a> </p>
<p>Outfit 1 or 2?<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f976.png" alt="🥶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a title="fy" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fy">#fy</a> <a title="foryou" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou">#foryou</a> <a title="styleinspiration" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/styleinspiration">#styleinspiration</a> <a title="fashioncouple" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fashioncouple">#fashioncouple</a> <a title="sneakerhack" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sneakerhack">#sneakerhack</a> <a title="outfittransition" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/outfittransition">#outfittransition</a> <a title="spring" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spring">#spring</a></p>
<p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Mask Off	 - Future	" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Mask-Off-6745304146598985730">♬ Mask Off	 &#8211; Future	</a> </section>
</blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>They can also be more complex. Think flipping your camera around, dropping your phone on the ground, zooming in and out — truly, the sky’s the limit. When someone really nails a transition, it’s almost impossible to watch the video just once. </p>
<p>You can try and figure out how to recreate a trending transition by reverse-engineering, but it’s easier to look up a tutorial, like this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pengpengclee/video/6961162544803351814?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=transitiontrends&amp;t=1639375796164">modern-day to old-timey transition trend</a> (here’s <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pengpengclee/video/6961163094760361222?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">the result from the tutorial</a>).</p>
<h3>5. Being vulnerable</h3>
<p>Calling this a “trend” sounds like accusing creators of being vulnerable to get views. That’s not the goal here — there’s a genuine need for honest content on TikTok.</p>
<p>We live in a heavily edited online world, but TikTok has a special corner for vulnerability. It’s not uncommon for users to post videos of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@patorisho/video/6963020278595177733?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=crying&amp;t=1639377316178">themselves crying</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@makenziemadisonn/video/7039527637202504965?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=go%20little%20rockstar&amp;t=1639377739078">in remembrance of a loved one</a>. Sharing difficult stories can really resonate with people and make them feel less alone. Look at the overwhelmingly positive and reassuring response to this video:</p>

<p>It’s perhaps less of a trend and more of a social movement away from the “everything’s perfect!”-ness of the internet. Either way, it’s a good thing.</p>
<h3>6. Asking for other creators to participate in the comments</h3>
<p>These TikToks are really simple to make and can blow up in no time. Simply type a prompt asking viewers of the video to “make the comments look like [something creative].”</p>
<p>For example, this one asks clever commenters to come up with their best family-vlogger Youtube video titles.</p>

<h3>7. Making TikToks with your family</h3>
<p>This one goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a good cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma or Grandpa. For example, just try and watch this family dance blooper without your heart exploding.</p>

<p>Because so many TikTok creators are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and fun) to see older people on the app. The trickiest part of this is convincing your family to participate, but if you’ve got <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mmmjoemele/video/6981263653253238021">one good sport</a>, you’ve struck gold.</p>
<h3>8. Referencing current pop culture</h3>
<p>Score some likes, comments and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan base. Trending TV shows and movies often spark their own TikTok trends (for example, two lines of dialogue from <em>Big Mouth</em> is now <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/You-Brussle-sprout-7027404713561705222">a sound used in over 90 thousand videos</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/No-Me-Diga-6972202367525586945">a song from <em>In the Heights</em></a> became the tune of choice for hundreds of thousands of gossipers).</p>
<p>When <em>Squid Game</em> swept the world in 2021, it sparked <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mic.hee.hee/video/7017911631594163462?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=squid%20game%20dalgona&amp;t=1639381395095">dalgona-making tutorials</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsjovynn/video/7014359799370452251?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=squid%20game%20red%20light%20green%20lights%20song&amp;t=1639381472081">musical mashups</a> and many, many, many tracksuits. This is just one of the millions of examples of how creative TikTok users referenced the show:</p>

<h3>9. Documenting a day in the life</h3>
<p>While “No one wants to see your avocado toast” is the chant of choice for grumpy anti-Instagrammers, the truth is, a lot of people want to see your avocado toast.</p>
<p>There’s something satisfying (see trend #11) about watching someone’s everyday routine, whether they’re a second-grade teacher, a lawyer or a couple who lives in a van. This “realistic day in van life” has been liked over 2 million times!</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@courtandnate/video/6974933411500657926" data-video-id="6974933411500657926" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" >

<p>Lots of these kinds of videos romanticize the mundane, but there’s plenty of room for humor in this video format too. If you’re a creator who gets lots of questions in your comments (see trend #10), a day in the life video can answer a bunch of those at once.</p>
<h3>10. Replying to a comment on an older TikTok to create a new one</h3>
<p>This is a simple way to create an ongoing dialogue with your followers. Use comments on already-posted videos to inspire new content, like this calligrapher did:</p>

<p>Establishing a reputation for replying to comments will only increase the number of comments you get on each TikTok (and <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-algorithm/">comments lead to more views, likes and followers</a>).</p>
<p>This is a great method for content generation if you’re using TikTok for your business. For example, waterproof sneaker brand Vessi used a comment as an opportunity to show people that their shoes are machine washable.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@vessi/video/6942541433614142726" data-video-id="6942541433614142726" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" >

<p>It always comes back to this, doesn’t it? Having a strong brand (whether it’s for your business or yourself) is always in style. Viewers appreciate consistent content — if you’re immediately recognizable, you’re doing it right.</p>
<p>Creators like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emilymariko?lang=en">Emily Mariko</a> have made an extra-identifiable brand (so much so, in fact, that it’s <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsallybitchesss/video/7026106715531644206?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=emily%20mariko&amp;t=1639390485236">inspiring satire</a>).</p>

<p>No matter the trend, stay true to yourself. To quote everyone’s mom (probably), “Just because all your friends are doing it doesn’t mean you have to do it too.”</p>
<p>Trends come and go so quickly. You could come across one that excites you at any moment — just make sure you jump on it, and fast!</p>

Or, the better question is: Are you posting when <em>your target audience</em> will see it?</p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to figure out the best social media posting schedule for your business.</p>

<h2>How to create your perfect social media posting schedule</h2>
<p>A posting schedule will keep you organized and ensure you create content in advance for all your upcoming social media marketing campaigns. But there isn’t a “one size fits all” perfect schedule. The ideal frequency and timing of your social posts will depend on your audience and industry, among other things.</p>
<p>To find your ideal times to post on social media, read through this five-step process. At the end, you’ll have a <em>wham-bam</em> complete plan for social media domination.</p>
<h3>1. Know your audience</h3>
<p>This is the most important step! In order for your social media schedule to work, you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your target audience?</li>
<li>What times of day are they online?</li>
<li>Where do they hang out online, and when? For example, do they start the day with Twitter and end the day doom-scrolling Instagram? (Don’t we all?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry if your audience is in a different timezone than you. We’ll cover social media scheduling tools later that will auto-post your content at the best times. (Hint: It’s Hootsuite. Hootsuite does that.)</p>
<h3>2. Understand how social media algorithms work</h3>
<p>Whenever content doesn’t perform well, many people are quick to blame “<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-definitions/algorithm/">the algorithm</a>.” And as much as sometimes content flops simply because it’s not great, algorithms <em>do</em> play an important role in what your audience sees on social media.</p>
<p>Every social platform has its own algorithm, which is a fancy word for saying: “A system that aims to understand what its users want, and then delivers that to their screens.”</p>
<p>How often you post is one of the factors that affect algorithms use to assess and distribute your content.</p>
<p>In June 2021, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri confirmed that posting two posts a week and two Stories per day is a best practice for success.</p>

<p>TikTok recommends posting <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/tiktok-creative-ultimate-guide">minimum once a day</a> and up to four times a day for best results. Once a day doesn’t sound like a lot until you realize that’s basically conceptualizing, scripting, shooting and editing what used to be a TV commercial every single day.</p>
<p>For Facebook, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-algorithm/">recency is a top algorithm factor</a>. Newer posts are always given more weight, even when combined with other ranking factors. It’s especially important to know when your target audience is on Facebook and post accordingly.</p>

<h3>3. Plan your campaigns in advance</h3>
<p>In addition to your mix of regular content, plan your big product launches, announcements and seasonal campaigns well in advance.</p>
<p>To keep everything organized, put together a high-level calendar. This isn’t just where you write and plan your post content. It exists as part of your social media content strategy to ensure you account for everything you need to get out into the world.</p>
<p>It’s your guide for what to post, not just when to post it.</p>
<p>It could be as simple as a to-do list to make sure you get everything done on time — without the last-minute rush:</p>
<p><strong>September</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draft copy for Black Friday/Cyber Monday campaign posts
<ul>
<li>5 text posts</li>
<li>7 photo/graphic ads</li>
<li>1 video ad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>October</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Produce visual assets for BF/CM campaign
<ul>
<li>Finalize by Oct 15th</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>November</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule and promote BF/CM posts</li>
</ul>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to Manage Hootsuite Content Campaigns" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qlI4GY-RHyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>4. Evaluate your performance</h3>
<p>You can post during every “hot” time to post from <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-twitter-instagram">this article</a> and hundreds of other sources online, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best schedule for you.</p>
<p>We’ve already talked about the importance of knowing when your audience is online. But you also need to run experiments.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re pulling in a thoroughly <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/organic-reach-declining/">average organic post reach of 5%</a>, or roughly 1 in 19 followers, but what if 6% of your audience could be seeing your posts? Or 7%? <em>Or 10%?!</em></p>
<p>Following the same social media posting schedule quarter after quarter, year after year, will likely hurt your growth.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you have to dramatically switch things up every week. You need a baseline to tell if any of your experiments are working. Try running one experiment a month. Change one of your usual posting days or times to a new one for a month and see which time slot performs better.</p>
<p>Small tweaks and experiments over time can yield big results. Think of it like A/B testing your social media.</p>
<h3>5. TL;DR? Post at these times</h3>
<p>You’ve reached the cheat sheet section of this article.</p>
<p>While all of the above is true, and you shouldn’t arbitrarily post content at times you find on the internet without doing proper audience research first… Well, if you’re not gonna follow my advice, here are some universal benchmarks for the best <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-twitter-instagram/">times you should post</a>, based on extensive research.</p>
<p>The best time to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-twitter-instagram/#Key_takeaways_about_the_best_time_to_post_on_social_media">post on social media</a> overall is <strong>10:00 AM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.</strong></p>
<p>But is that when <em>your</em> audience is online? Who knows!</p>
<p>Scheduling your content at these times is a good starting point that should be followed up with a review of your analytics and audience research. That will allow you to come up with a personalized and truly effective posting schedule that will work for <em>your</em> brand and <em>your</em> audience.</p>
<h2>Free template: Social media posting schedule</h2>
<p>OK, so you know what you’re going to post about from your <a href="https://education.hootsuite.com/pages/importance-of-a-social-media-content-strategy">social content strategy</a>. You now know also how to find the best times to post on social media for your audience. Now, how do you make it all happen?</p>
<p>Use this free <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/blog/social-media-content-calendar">social media posting schedule template</a> created for Google Sheets (so it’s easy to edit anytime, anywhere and collaborate with your team).</p>
<p>Here’s how to get the most from it:</p>
<h3>Make a copy</h3>
<p>The file is going to open as a read-only Google Sheet. Click <strong>File</strong>, then <strong>Make a copy</strong> to create your own editable version of the sheet that will be stored in your Google account.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule2.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-303029" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule2-620x224.png" alt="Google Sheets social media posting schedule template" width="620" height="224" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule2-620x224.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule2-310x112.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule2-768x277.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule2.png 812w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>You’ll see a tutorial for how to use it on the first tab, so check that out. You can delete that tab from your own copy.</p>
<h3>Edit it for your needs</h3>
<p>The schedule shows one week of content planning for all the major social platforms.</p>
<p>Don’t post on all the social networks listed? Delete rows. Post on ones not included? Add rows. Don’t want to post daily? Edit the schedule. You get the idea. Make the template fit your business.</p>
<p>Once you have it set up to work for your social media platforms, posting frequency and times, copy and paste rows so that you can write a month’s worth of content in the tab.</p>
<p>Then, duplicate that tab 11 times to create your entire social media content planner for the entire year. <em>#mindblown </em>To do that, right-click on the tab’s name at the bottom and click <strong>Duplicate</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule3.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-303037" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule3.png" alt="Duplicate option on template" width="549" height="765" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule3.png 549w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule3-310x432.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></a></p>
<h3>Add your content</h3>
<p>Time for the best part. Get in there and start writing out your social media content.</p>
<p>You don’t need to plan months or even weeks ahead. If you don’t already have a content production process, aim for creating content a week ahead of time at first. Of course, large campaigns will need more planning.</p>
<p>The template offers suggestions on types of content to post, from sharing your latest blog post to a video or something curated. Modify these content categories to be what you post about.</p>
<p>Then… get to work:</p>
<p>Those are the basics to plan your content, but this spreadsheet can do a whole lot more. See our detailed <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/">social media calendar guide</a> for more tips on using this template, like how to create an evergreen content library and more.</p>
<h2>How to schedule social media posts</h2>
<p>Hootsuite makes it easy to schedule all your social media posts in one place.</p>
<p>There are two ways to schedule your posts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individually</li>
<li>Bulk upload</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to schedule individual social media posts</h3>
<p>Using the Hootsuite Planner, you can schedule individual posts for all your connected social media accounts. You can set it to post to only one account or multiple profiles, and edit your content to look just right on each platform.</p>
<p>You can schedule and auto-post the following content formats with Hootsuite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook feed posts</li>
<li>Instagram feed posts</li>
<li>Instagram Stories</li>
<li>Tweets</li>
<li>LinkedIn posts</li>
<li>YouTube videos</li>
<li>Pins (on Pinterest)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a quick tutorial on how to schedule a post with Hootsuite Planner:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Getting the Most Out of Hootsuite Planner" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nbI4x2Xq7EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>No time to watch? No sweat. Here’s how to schedule a post in three quick steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In Hootsuite, click <strong>Create</strong>, then<strong> Post</strong> (or <strong>Pin</strong>) on the left-side menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule5.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-303053" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule5-620x715.png" alt="pin or post on Hootsuite" width="503" height="580" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule5-620x715.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule5-310x357.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule5-768x885.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule5.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Build your post.</p>
<p>Select the platform(s) you want to post to and write or paste in your content. Add a link, photo, video or other assets.</p>
<p>A feature I personally love is the ability to tag people or brands. If you write @hootsuite, for example, it will automatically prompt you to select the appropriate account to tag on each platform. This saves time and ensures you’re tagging the right account.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule6.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-303061" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule6-620x355.png" alt="Build Twitter post on Hootsuite Planner" width="620" height="355" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule6-620x355.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule6-310x178.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule6-768x440.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule6-1536x881.png 1536w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule6-2048x1174.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Pick a time — or have AutoScheduler do it for you!</p>
<p><a href="https://help.hootsuite.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404937701147-Schedule-posts-at-recommended-times#scheduling-at-recommended-times-from-the-composer-0-0">Hootsuite AutoScheduler</a> chooses the best time to post based on your performance history and audience. Posts can also be saved as drafts or posted immediately.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule7.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-303069" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-posting-schedule7.png" alt="Hootsuite AutoScheduler recommended times" width="200" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>And that’s it!</p>
<h3>How to bulk schedule your social media posts</h3>
<p>With Hootsuite, you can also save time by uploading and scheduling up to 350 posts with one click.</p>
<p>Here’s a walkthrough explaining how Hootsuite’s Bulk Composer works:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to Schedule Posts in Bulk Using Hootsuite" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyrlryIfY_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Bulk scheduling is convenient, but there are a few best practices to be aware of for each platform to maximize your reach.</p>

<h2>3 useful social media scheduling tools</h2>
<h3>Hootsuite Planner</h3>
<p>Hootsuite Planner is where you can view and edit your upcoming scheduled posts. It’s like the “mission control center” for your social content.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick video showing you how to get the most out of the Planner tool in under two minutes:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Getting the Most Out of Hootsuite Planner" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nbI4x2Xq7EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Hootsuite Best Time to Publish</h3>
<p>Hootsuite’s <a href="https://help.hootsuite.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260804306589-Suggestions-for-the-best-times-to-publish-on-social#view-suggestions-for-the-best-times-to-publish-your-posts-0-0">Best Time to Publish</a> feature, found under Analytics, analyzes your past performance to show you data for the best times to post on each of your social platforms.</p>
<p>But, there’s no “best” time to publish for everything, so this tool goes one step further than the rest and breaks down different suggested times for three key goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building awareness</li>
<li>Increasing engagement</li>
<li>Driving traffic</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows you to map each piece of content to business goals and optimize your scheduling for maximum ROI. (Feel free to copy/paste that tech broetry sentence to your boss to justify getting Hootsuite.)</p>

<p>But how exactly do you get TikTok famous, and why should you bother anyway? Read on to find out.</p>

<h2>The benefits of becoming famous on TikTok</h2>
<p>TikTok currently sits at 1 billion active users, which makes it the<a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/digital-trends"> 7th largest social media network</a> in the world.</p>
<p>The app has over 73 million users in the United States alone (meaning roughly 22% of the country’s population uses TikTok).</p>
<p>And while users under the age of 19 are still the largest demographic on the platform, TikTok is by no means a “lip-syncing app for kids” anymore. In 2021, all age groups have a solid representation on the platform:</p>
<figure id="attachment_302904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-302904" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TikTok-famous.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-302904 size-large" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TikTok-famous-620x392.png" alt="Distribution of TikTok users in the United States as of March 2021, by age group" width="620" height="392" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TikTok-famous-620x392.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TikTok-famous-310x196.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TikTok-famous-768x486.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TikTok-famous.png 1410w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-302904" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Distribution of TikTok users in the United States as of March 2021, by age group (Source: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/">Statista</a>)</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Combine this with TikTok’s ultra-engaging algorithm, and the benefits of using the platform (for marketing or personal fame) become clear: No matter what demographic you’re trying to reach online, you’re likely to find a highly engaged slice of it on TikTok.</p>
<h2>Can you become TikTok famous overnight?</h2>
<p>You’ve probably heard that it’s easy to get famous on TikTok. And that’s true. But only in comparison to older social networks like Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>That’s because <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-algorithm/">the TikTok algorithm</a> doesn’t recommend content based on follower count, making it much easier for new users to rack up views and grow their accounts.</p>
<p>TikTok will recommend your clips on the For You page (the app’s home page and main feed) if they’re similar to what your audience is already watching and interacting with.</p>
<p>But even so, a million engaged followers are unlikely to fall into your lap overnight. </p>
<p>I’m not saying you won’t wake up one morning to find your latest clip has gone viral and your local paper wants to do a piece on you. But <em>real</em> fame takes more than one <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-go-viral-on-tiktok/">viral TikTok video</a>.</p>
<p>To build your base, you need to match viral success with more videos that hit the TikTok sweet spot.</p>
<p>“How do you do that?”, I hear you ask. Let’s take a look at some strategies that will bring you closer to TikTok fame.</p>
<h2>How to become TikTok famous: 6 strategies</h2>
<h3>1. Build a recognizable brand</h3>
<p>TikTok is not the place to be a Jack or Jane of all trades. Most famous TikTok influencers pick a niche and build their personal brand around it. Visit any of the big hitter’s profiles, and you’ll see video after video of the same kind of content.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some examples!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zachking?lang=en">Zach King</a> (who is, unironically one of the kings of TikTok) amassed 66.4 million followers by posting clip after clip of mind-bending special effects. His videos, as he puts it, bring “a little more wonder into the world, 15 seconds at a time.”</p>
<p>Case in point, this 19 million views (and counting) video of Zach reversing into what appears to be a perfectly average car… until it’s not!</p>

<p>Here’s another example: #CottageCore queen <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aclotheshorse?lang=en">A Clothes Horse</a>. Her relentlessly whimsical, dress-clad outings have earned her 1.2 million followers to date.</p>

<p>The takeaway here is to get specific. Pick a topic or theme you know a lot about and run with it. Consistently!</p>
<h3>2. Find your niche</h3>
<p>On TikTok, people spend more time engaging with suggested content and accounts they don’t already follow than on other social platforms.</p>
<p>That’s because TikTok’s home screen, the <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-for-you-page/">For You page</a>, is a personalized feed of content that the algorithm thinks you will like. (And based on our team’s vigorous testing, a.k.a. countless hours spent browsing TikTok, the algorithm usually gets it right.)</p>
<p>The For You page algorithm bases its recommendations on what you’ve liked and engaged with before (as well as <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-algorithm/">other metrics</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-to-get-TikTok-famous.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-302896" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-to-get-TikTok-famous-620x1221.png" alt="Beyonce on TikTok For You Page" width="500" height="984" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-to-get-TikTok-famous-620x1221.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-to-get-TikTok-famous-310x610.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-to-get-TikTok-famous-768x1512.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-to-get-TikTok-famous-780x1536.png 780w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-to-get-TikTok-famous-1040x2048.png 1040w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-to-get-TikTok-famous.png 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>In other words, to get famous on TikTok, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the trending hashtags used by the subculture or niche.</li>
<li>Use those hashtags consistently when you post videos.</li>
<li>Follow them so you can keep up with emerging trends in your niche.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s PlayStation demonstrating exactly what that looks like.</p>
<p>In this ThanksGiving-themed post, the global gaming company uses the hashtag #gamingontiktok to connect with the platform’s gaming culture.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@playstation/video/7034555403333782831" data-video-id="7034555403333782831" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" >

<p>Playstation could have just used their branded hashtag. But they know they’ll reach a wider audience using the broader tags of their audience’s subculture.</p>
<p>You can find relevant hashtags by identifying the most popular accounts in your niche. Then checking the non-branded tags they use on their best-performing posts.</p>
<h3>3. Know TikTok trends</h3>
<p>TikTok might not have invented memes and internet trends, but it’s definitely where they now live. Or at least start.</p>
<p>So, if you want to get famous on TikTok, you need to find, follow and take part in the platform&#8217;s trends.</p>
<p>To find trends on TikTok:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the #trendalert and #tiktokchallenge hashtags. (Yep, it can be that simple.)</li>
<li>Check well-performing posts on competitors’ profiles.</li>
<li>Spend some time scrolling through your For You page.</li>
<li>Use the Discover tab (save the best till last, right?).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Discover tab is similar to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/get-brand-instagrams-explore-page/">Instagram’s Explore</a>, except it breaks down content by trend type.</p>
<p>You can find the Discover tab at the bottom of your screen in the TikTok app.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.44.43-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-302912" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.44.43-PM.png" alt="Discover tab on TikTok" width="500" height="962" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.44.43-PM.png 580w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.44.43-PM-310x596.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Under Discover, you’ll find trending sounds (music and other audio clips you can add to your videos), effects (TikTok’s in-app effects) and hashtags.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.24-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-302920" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.24-PM.png" alt="trending sounds and hashtags on TikTok" width="500" height="878" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.24-PM.png 542w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.24-PM-310x545.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Adding trending music, effects and hashtags to your videos opens up a much wider audience to your content.</p>
<p>But don’t just replicate what others are doing. Put your own spin on it.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Well… say you want in on the #christmasbaking trend. But, you only post original content showcasing ridiculous food challenges. So you could, for example, challenge yourself to eat only Christmas-themed foods for an entire day.</p>
<p>I give you, exhibit A:</p>

Neat, right?</p>
<p>And remember,<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-algorithm/"> 61% of people</a> say they find brands more likable when they take part in TikTok trends.</p>
<h3>4. Post often</h3>
<p>Unlike other social networks, TikTok won’t punish you for posting (too) often. Every time you post to TikTok, you create a new opportunity to show up on people’s For You pages. And many top TikTokers swear that posting high quality content daily is their secret to TikTok success.</p>
<p>This tactic helped Netflix attract 21.3m followers. And they’re pretty prolific! Even by TikTok standards.</p>
<p>Netflix frequently posts 5-6 videos in a single day.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.30-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-302928" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.30-PM.png" alt="Netflix account on TikTok" width="500" height="921" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.30-PM.png 508w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.30-PM-310x571.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>On top of finding your ideal posting frequency, you should also try to time each TikTok to reach as big of a slice of your target audience as possible when they&#8217;re online. Here&#8217;s a quick guide to finding your custom best times to post on TikTok:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Find your BEST time to post on Tiktok in 5 steps (Ignore generic advice!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ldqxKXGjRFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>5. Engage with your followers</h3>
<p>In many ways, TikTok is not like other social networks —but when it comes to engagement, it’s the same. Just like Facebook and Instagram, TikTok’s algorithm rewards content and creators that inspire engagement with posts.</p>
<p>On TikTok, engagement means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Likes</li>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Shares</li>
<li>Saves</li>
<li>Favorites</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best ways to increase engagement with your posts is to regularly respond to your followers. Take a leaf out of Ryanair’s book and reply to every comment you get.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.35-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-302936" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.35-PM-620x838.png" alt="Ryanair comment response" width="500" height="676" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.35-PM-620x838.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.35-PM-310x419.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-13-at-3.47.35-PM.png 706w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>That might sound like a chore, but it’s helped the airline amass 1.3m followers so far.</p>
<p>You might want to save a bit of energy for this last strategy though…</p>
<h3>6. Engage with other TikTok users</h3>
<p>Just as on other social networks, brands can easily share user-generated content to their TikTok accounts. American clothing brand Aerie often uses this tactic because it fits well with their brand ideal of showcasing authentic beauty.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@aerie/video/7032659995070221615" data-video-id="7032659995070221615" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" >

<p>TikTok has unique features that allow users to react and respond to other people’s clips in video form.</p>
<p>Using TikTok’s native tools, you can Duet, Stitch and video reply to a clip.</p>
<p>Duet creates a split-screen clip that features the original video on one side and your version, response or reply on the other side. It looks like this…</p>

<p>Stitch allows you to weave part of a user’s clip into your video. According to TikTok, Stich “is a way to reinterpret and add to another user’s content.”</p>
<p>Uber-famous TikToker <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@khaby.lame?">khaby.lame</a> lives on Stitch content. He’s gained 123m followers stitching together videos of weird internet life hacks with his common sense versions.</p>

Unfortunately, businesses aren’t always sure what that value is. That’s where social media goals come in.</p>
<p>If making compelling social media content is your specialty, it can be intimidating when you have to translate business speak into social marketing. But all is not lost.</p>
<p>With this guide to setting social media goals, you’ll be able to figure out what your company needs — even when your company isn’t sure what it needs.</p>

<h2><strong>What are social media goals?</strong></h2>
<p>A social media goal is a statement about what you want to achieve with your marketing activity. The goal can apply to anything from a single ad buy, or you can create social media campaign goals.</p>
<p>A social media goal isn’t the same thing as <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-marketing-plan/">a social media strategy</a>, although both are important. You can think of social media goals as the building blocks for your social media strategy.</p>
<p>The benefits of learning how to set social media goals are numerous. Well-made goals will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>structure and streamline your workflow,</li>
<li>manage your budget,</li>
<li>demonstrate your marketing’s <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/measure-social-media-roi-business/">return on investment</a>,</li>
<li>align your social media activity with your organization’s wider business goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hootsuite’s <a href="https://education.hootsuite.com/courses/social-marketing-certification">Social Marketing Certification</a> course has a section about setting strategic goals. It&#8217;s a great choice if you want to become an expert in goal setting for social media marketing.</p>
<h2><strong>How to set social media goals in 5 steps</strong></h2>
<p>Setting a social media goal doesn’t have to be complicated, but it does help to have a structure to guide you.</p>
<p>Set goals that get you where you need to be by making them SMART. They are <strong>s</strong>pecific, <strong>m</strong>easurable, <strong>a</strong>ttainable, <strong>r</strong>elevant, and <strong>time-bound</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Specific. </strong></h3>
<p>What <em>exactly</em> do you want to achieve? It’s fine to start with a general direction, but your ultimate goal should be as precise as possible.</p>
<h3><strong>Measurable</strong></h3>
<p>How will you know when you’ve achieved your goal? If you can’t find a few quantifiable indicators to define success, your goal might not be specific enough.</p>
<p>You’ll want to think about which <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-metrics">social metrics</a> you can use to measure your success.</p>
<h3><strong>Attainable</strong></h3>
<p>Did you set a realistic social media goal? If your goal is to reach a million dollars in sales, and you just launched your business yesterday, you haven’t set a very good goal. Try starting that journey of a thousand miles with a really strong first step.</p>
<h3><strong>Relevant</strong></h3>
<p>Does the goal fit into your overall plan? Each goal should be a focused piece of a larger picture.</p>
<p>Useful goals are relevant to a problem that needs solving. Consider conducting an <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-audit-template/">audit of your current social media activity</a>. This helps you better understand where you are and where you need to go.</p>
<h3><strong>Time-bound</strong></h3>
<p>Can you achieve the goal in a specific amount of time? If you can’t come up with a timeline for your goal, that might be a sign that the goal isn&#8217;t specific or attainable enough.</p>
<h2><strong>9 example social media goals</strong></h2>
<p>The social media goals you set should always reflect your organization’s specific needs. But many goals can be applied to almost any social media campaign.</p>
<p>The following examples will help you frame your work in concrete, actionable terms. All you have to do is make them SMART for your brand.</p>
<h3><strong>Build brand awareness</strong></h3>
<p>Building <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-definitions/brand-awareness/">brand awareness</a> means increasing the number of people who are aware of your brand.</p>
<p>This goal is best in situations like launching a new product or breaking into a new market. It never hurts to make people more aware of your brand. But brand awareness is usually the first step to bigger things.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-metrics/#Awareness_metrics">measure brand awareness</a> with specific metrics like</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post reach:</strong> how many people have seen a post since it went live.</li>
<li><strong>Audience growth rate:</strong> how many people have seen a post since it went live.</li>
<li><strong>Potential reach: </strong>the number of people who could, realistically, see a post during a reporting period.</li>
<li><strong>Social share of voice: </strong>how many people are mentioning your brand on social media compared to your competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specialized social monitoring tools, like Hootsuite <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/platform/analyze">Analytics</a> or <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/products/insights">Insights</a>, can give you advanced tools that let you track what people are saying about you even when they’re not using your @handle or branded hashtags.</p>
<p>Video social media platforms are great choices for building brand awareness. These include YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Stories and Reels. These platforms allow you to take advantage of the increased attention video commands.</p>
<h3><strong>Manage brand reputation</strong></h3>
<p>Trust in your brand is one of the most precious commodities you can generate with your social media marketing. Goals to manage your brand reputation aim to influence your public’s attitudes about you.</p>
<p>The metrics for brand reputation are similar to those of brand awareness. You’ll want to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/brand-monitoring/">track brand mentions and relevant hashtags</a> on social media.</p>
<p>There are also tools for performing <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-sentiment-analysis-tools/">social media sentiment analysis</a>. These tools measure what exactly those mentions are saying about you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/products/insights">Hootsuite Insights</a> provides a deep dive into your brand&#8217;s reputation. Its tools can extract relevant information from 1.3 trillion social media posts in real-time.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hootsuite Insights Powered by Brandwatch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DTVXqDmoOcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Social audio platforms can be very effective for influencing your brand’s reputation. These include Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces, and Spotify. Users’ attention and engagement on these platforms give you the opportunity to express your brand’s identity in depth.</p>
<h3><strong>Increase traffic to your website</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes you just want to get eyeballs on your website. Your website is a key element in your social media presence. It connects a click on an advertisement to the rest of your online presence.</p>
<p>Increasing website traffic is a good goal to use when you’ve got your online presence in place and all you need is people to use it.</p>
<p>Measuring website traffic is relatively simple. Unique visits to your website can be measured over the most relevant period of time. That can mean daily, weekly, or monthly, for example. You can also track where your visitors are coming from to find out which platforms are working for you best. </p>
<h3><strong>Improve community engagement</strong></h3>
<p>Engagement refers to any form of visible interaction with your brand on social media. Likes, comments, and shares are all forms of engagement.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-engagement/">Improving engagement</a> can target the quantity or quality of your audience’s interaction with you on social media.</p>
<p>Having an engaged audience is a huge asset for almost any brand. Engagement goals are useful when your company is preparing to launch a new product. They&#8217;re also useful when you&#8217;re simply aiming to maintain an existing offer.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/calculate-engagement-rate/">calculate social media engagement</a>. Some look at your entire social media activity. Others focus on specific posts or types of engagement. The most important ones include</p>
<p>Hootsuite provides a <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/blog/engagement-rate-calculator">free engagement calculator</a> to give you the figures you need without any fuss.</p>
<h3><strong>Boost conversions or sales</strong></h3>
<p>A conversion is when a user takes some kind of action on your social media posts or website. This can mean signing up for a newsletter, registering for a webinar, or making a purchase.</p>
<p>Say your brand has a strong social media presence that isn’t translating into a healthier bottom line. Conversion goals are especially useful in situations like these.</p>
<p>Depending on your specific objectives, you might <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-metrics/#Conversion_metrics">measure conversion</a> by</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion rate: the number of visitors who, after clicking on a link in your post, take action on a page divided by that page’s total visitors.</li>
<li>Click-Through Rate (CTR): how often people click on the call-to-action link in your post.</li>
<li>Social Media Conversion Rate: the percentage of conversions from social media.</li>
<li>Bounce rate: No, not how often you listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi-eGzxTIjA">Big Freedia</a>. Bounce rate measures the percentage of users that click on one of your links, only to leave without taking any action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social platforms that have integrated shopping tools are most effective for conversion goals. These include Pinterest Product Pins, Facebook Shops, Instagram Shops, TikTok, and Shopify.</p>
<h3><strong>Generate leads</strong></h3>
<p>Not every interaction will result in a sale. To keep in touch with potential customers, you might want to set a goal to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-generate-leads-on-social-media/">generate more social leads</a>.</p>
<p>The leads that you generate can be any information that helps you follow up with a social media user. That includes names, email addresses, occupations, employers, or any other information they share.</p>
<p>Leads are a specific kind of conversion. Because of this, the two goals are useful in similar situations. They’re also measured in similar ways. But lead goals are even more targeted for situations. For example, when your company is looking to convert a strong social media presence into sales.</p>
<p>The best platform for generating leads is Facebook. This edge comes from its massive audience size and sophisticated analytics tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-goals-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-302732" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-goals-1.png" alt="Best Social Media Platforms for Lead Generation: eMarketer chart shows Facebook is #1" width="470" height="342" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-goals-1.png 470w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-goals-1-310x226.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>
<p>Be aware that many of Facebook’s lead-generating advantages come from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/facebook-accused-of-still-targeting-teens-with-ads/">tools that raise serious user privacy concerns</a>. These technologies continue to be subject to a <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/as-facebook-pushes-a-replacement-for-its-increasingly-weak-tracker-advertisers-weigh-privacy-risk-and-reward/">tug-of-war between privacy technology and surveillance technology</a>. As a result, the quality of the data they provide may vary.</p>
<p>To learn more about generating high-quality leads, we’ve put together a <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-generate-leads-on-social-media/">guide dedicated to social media leads</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Deliver customer service</strong></h3>
<p>Your social presence isn’t just about attracting new customers. It’s also a place to keep the customers you already have. Goals to improve <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-customer-service/">customer service on social media</a> can take on a variety of forms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a new customer support channel on social media</li>
<li>Reduce wait times</li>
<li>Increase customer satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<p>The way to measure the success of your social customer service will depend on how you’ve formulated your goal. Usually, you&#8217;ll use data from customer testimonials and customer satisfaction surveys. Internal measurements like the number of service requests handled per customer service representative can also be useful.</p>
<p>Conversational social media platforms are the ideal place to focus on for your customer service-related goals. Twitter and Facebook are the two most popular.</p>
<h3><strong>Gain market insights with social listening</strong></h3>
<p>If your biggest need right now is to find out what you need to know, you might want to set a goal to improve your <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-listening-business/">business’s social listening</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Social listening in 3 steps (POV: you have no budget)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCAKH9SaWnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Social listening refers to a two-step process. First, you track social media activity relevant to your brand. Then you analyze that information for insights about your industry.</p>
<p>The main metrics to track in social listening include</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand mentions</li>
<li>Relevant hashtags</li>
<li>Competitor mentions</li>
<li>Industry trends</li>
<li>Social sentiment</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting social listening goals can help you engage with your audience more effectively. They also help show the value of social marketing next time budgeting season rolls around.</p>
<h3><strong>Attract candidates for open positions</strong></h3>
<p>Using social media to fill open positions in your company is another kind of conversion. In this case, you’re targeting a particular kind of user interaction: submitting a resume.</p>
<p>You’ll want to attract quality conversions rather than quantity. Learn <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-for-business/">how to use your company’s LinkedIn account</a>. This will help attract the best candidates for your positions.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to Use Hootsuite for LinkedIn: 2021 Edition" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ld45kHGPBiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>If you follow the advice in these social media marketing goals, you’ll be well on your way to making SMART social media goals. Even if you don’t succeed, a SMART goal helps you learn from your mistakes. You’ll be putting yourself in a win-win scenario. Either you succeed or you gain valuable information.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Placements</strong> section, check where you want your post to be published. You will be able to publish it to your Page and the connected Instagram account at the same time.</p>

<h3><strong>How to schedule multiple Facebook posts at once in Hootsuite</strong></h3>
<p>Hootsuite’s <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-bulk-schedule/">bulk schedule tool</a> makes handling a busy posting schedule more efficient. The tool lets you schedule a maximum of 350 posts at once.</p>
<p>To schedule multiple Facebook posts, save your Facebook content as a CSV file.</p>
<p>Include these details for each post:</p>
<ul>
<li>The date and time (using 24-hour time) that your post should publish.</li>
<li>The caption.</li>
<li>A URL (this is optional).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can’t add emojis, images or videos to bulk posts. But you can include those afterward by editing each individual scheduled post in Hootsuite.</p>
<p>After you upload your CSV file, the Bulk Composer asks you to review all the posts. Once you’ve made your edits and uploaded any additional media files, select<strong> Schedule</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that you can edit individual posts afterward in Hootsuite’s Publisher (in the Planner and Content tab).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302709" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hootsuite-vs-FB-business-suite-620x964.png" alt="comparison chart: Hootsuite and Facebook Business Suite" width="620" height="964" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hootsuite-vs-FB-business-suite-620x964.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hootsuite-vs-FB-business-suite-310x482.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hootsuite-vs-FB-business-suite-768x1194.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hootsuite-vs-FB-business-suite-988x1536.png 988w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hootsuite-vs-FB-business-suite.png 1122w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Hootsuite&#8217;s Facebook scheduler also has a <strong>Best Time to Publish</strong> feature that comes up with personalized recommendations for when you should post, based on your account&#8217;s historical performance. The system suggests times specific to your goals (building brand awareness, boosting engagement or increasing sales), setting your posts up for the best visibility and performance possible.</p>

<h2><strong>5 tips for scheduling Facebook posts</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you use a Facebook scheduler like Hootsuite or schedule posts directly on Facebook, you should follow these best practices:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Always stay on brand</strong></h3>
<p>When scheduling posts, the pressure to post immediately is off. So take the time to craft relevant content that will land with your audience.</p>
<p>Scheduling posts can also help you keep your brand guidelines in mind when composing weeks or months-worth of content. Make sure that your campaigns across Pages and even social networks are aligned with yours and your audience’s values.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Carefully choose the publication date and time </strong></h3>
<p>Avoid posting when your audience isn’t online. Hootsuite&#8217;s Facebook scheduler comes with a<a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/platform/analyze"> Best Time to Publish feature</a> that will help you schedule Facebook posts on days and at times when your audience is active on the platform.</p>
<p>The more people see your Facebook updates, the more opportunity there is to generate engagement, drive traffic and gain potential new followers.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Know when to pause your Facebook posts</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t forget about the posts you’ve scheduled. Always consider how current events or crises could change the meaning and tone of the posts you wrote well before those events — they may become irrelevant or insensitive in ways you simply could not have predicted.</p>
<p>Regularly check in on your scheduled posts to keep track of what’s coming up. That way, you can pause or delete scheduled posts before they’re published, and avoid any potential backlash.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Remember that you can’t schedule <em>everything</em></strong></h3>
<p>Some things you have to post about in real-time. And some types of posts cannot be scheduled at all. On Facebook, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook events</li>
<li>Facebook check-ins</li>
<li>Photo albums</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Track analytics and engagement</strong></h3>
<p>A good posting schedule shouldn’t be based on guesswork. You’ll know what works best for your Facebook audience by monitoring your performance in a <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-analytics/">social media analytics tool</a>.</p>
<p>Historical data will show you what posts perform well, and where you could make improvements.</p>

<h2>What is YouTube marketing?</h2>
<p>YouTube marketing is the practice of promoting a brand, product, or service on YouTube. It can involve a mix of tactics, including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating organic promotional videos</li>
<li>Working with influencers</li>
<li>Advertising on the platform</li>
</ul>
<p>To <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/youtube">market your business on YouTube</a> — whether you’re an entrepreneur or an enterprise corporation — you need to produce what your target customers want. Sounds simple, right? It is, as long as you know what your customers <em>really</em> want and it’s not just what you <em>think</em> they want, which is a trap far too many businesses fall into.</p>
<p>Plus, you need to make sure the right people find your videos. YouTube is a search engine so you’ll need to optimize your content for the <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-the-youtube-algorithm-works/">YouTube algorithm</a>, just like you do for Google SEO.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here is your complete, step-by-step checklist for how to successfully promote your business on YouTube.</p>
<h2>Your 10-step YouTube marketing strategy</h2>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Create a YouTube channel for your business</strong></h3>
<p>First things first, you have to set up a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Since YouTube is part of Google, you’ll need to create a Google account first to sign up for a YouTube channel. You can use an existing account or create one especially for managing your business.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get up and running:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Google account.</li>
<li>Use that to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1646861?hl=en">create your YouTube account</a>.</li>
<li>Log in to YouTube and create a Brand Account and channel.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-3.png.webp"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302589" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-3.png-620x344.webp" alt="create a Brand Account" width="620" height="344" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-3.png-620x344.webp 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-3.png-310x172.webp 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-3.png-768x426.webp 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-3.png.webp 987w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>Managing your YouTube channel with a Brand Account is a best practice, as opposed to running it with your personal Google account. For one thing, a Brand Account lets multiple people in your company manage and update your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>For another, no one at work needs to know your personal email is <em>sk8rboi2000@gmail.com</em>. (Your secret’s safe with me.)</p>
<p>More importantly, it also allows you to expand your business later with additional YouTube channels.</p>
<p>OK, you’ve got the account. Next up: pretty it up.</p>
<p>Add your:</p>
<ul>
<li>“About” information.</li>
<li>Channel art (the “header” image and profile picture).</li>
<li>Social media and website links.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-youtube-account-channel/">step-by-step walkthrough to create a YouTube account</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Now we’re ready to tackle your YouTube video marketing strategy.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Learn about your audience</strong></h3>
<p>Alright, now for the tough stuff. What does your audience really want?</p>
<p>To figure this out, you need to answer two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are you making videos for?</li>
<li>What are they already watching on YouTube?</li>
</ol>
<p>To start, it’s helpful to know some basic <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-demographics/#YouTube_demographics">YouTube demographics</a>. YouTube has over 2 billion users and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/810461/us-youtube-reach-gender/">72% of American internet users</a> regularly browse YouTube. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/296227/us-youtube-reach-age-gender/">77% of people</a> aged 15-35 use YouTube and unlike other social platforms, there isn’t a large dropoff in that rate for older users.</p>
<figure id="attachment_302605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-302605" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-302605 size-large" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-5-620x397.jpg" alt="Statista YouTube demographics by age and reach" width="620" height="397" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-5-620x397.jpg 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-5-310x198.jpg 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-5-768x491.jpg 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-5.jpg 1426w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-302605" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/296227/us-youtube-reach-age-gender/">Statista</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube isn’t only popular in the USA. There are over <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-demographics/#YouTube_demographics">100 localized versions</a> of YouTube for countries around the world.</p>
<p>Spend some time researching who your target audience is already following on YouTube. What types of videos do they watch? (If you don’t have your target audience figured out yet, we have a <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/buyer-persona/">free buyer persona template</a> to help out.)</p>
<p>There are a couple ways to do this:</p>
<h4>If you already have your YouTube channel set up, check out your <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/">Analytics tab</a>.</h4>
<p>This will give you valuable insights into your audience’s demographics and interests. You can see how many people are finding your videos through search, seeing it in their suggested feed or from other sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-6.webp"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302613" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-6-620x306.webp" alt="Analytics tag on YouTube including traffic source" width="620" height="306" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-6-620x306.webp 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-6-310x153.webp 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-6-768x379.webp 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-6.webp 1012w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<h4>Use social listening to find your audience.</h4>
<p>What’s the best way to form lasting connections with other people? By spying on them from a distance, of course.</p>
<p>No, seriously, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-listening-business/">social listening</a> allows you to continuously search social platforms, including YouTube, for mentions of your brand or specific keywords.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Social Listening with Hootsuite Streams" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zRRkfkFZ0CM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>By seeing what people are saying about you or your industry, you can find out what people want to know and use that for video content ideas.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Research your competition</strong></h3>
<p>The fastest way to grow on YouTube is to figure out what’s working for your competition and then do that… but better.</p>
<p>You can start by looking up channels from the competitors you already know. Perform a <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/competitive-analysis-on-social-media/">competitor analysis</a> for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscriber count</li>
<li>Average views per video</li>
<li>Frequency of posting</li>
<li>Overall video quality</li>
<li>What people are saying in the comments</li>
<li>The main topics they post about</li>
</ul>
<p>And then ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are their most popular videos?</li>
<li>How are they presenting themselves?</li>
<li>What is their brand voice?</li>
<li>How can I differentiate my company from them?</li>
<li>What ideas can I get for new content from this channel?</li>
</ul>
<p>Put all your notes into a SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for <strong>S</strong>trengths, <strong>W</strong>eaknesses, <strong>O</strong>pportunities and <strong>T</strong>hreats (and always makes me feel like a Secret Service agent when I casually mention <em>I’m gonna go do a SWOT</em> to my coworkers by the coffee machine).</p>
<p>We’ve got a <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/competitive-analysis-on-social-media/#Social_media_competitive_analysis_template">free SWOT template</a> to get you goin’ right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/blog/competitive-analysis-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-302621 size-large" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-7-620x305.webp" alt="social media competitive analysis template" width="620" height="305" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-7-620x305.webp 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-7-310x152.webp 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-7-768x378.webp 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-7.webp 1371w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>At first, your goal is probably to grow your subscribers and audience as fast as possible. So write down your competitors’ subscriber counts and views. Track your own progress against theirs monthly.</p>
<p>Plus, if you’re competitive like me, the desire to crush their numbers will motivate you to keep going with your channel, even if growth is slow at first.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Learn from your favorite channels</strong></h3>
<p>Besides learning from your competitors, you should also be learning from your favorite YouTube channels. These don’t have to be channels related to your industry.</p>
<p>By consuming YouTube content, you will learn a lot about what’s working, especially since it’s always changing. </p>
<p>For example, did you know it’s <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/hafu_guo_youtube_growth/#7_Go_beyond_your_comfort_zone">more important to have good audio quality</a> than video quality? It’s true: Bad audio can turn people off from watching your video or subscribing.</p>
<p>A lot goes into making YouTube videos people want to watch. When you watch others, pay attention to things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video thumbnails</li>
<li>Channel art</li>
<li>How other creators are linking to posts or products</li>
<li>How other creators edit their videos, including text popups and other special effects</li>
</ul>
<p>There are even entire channels devoted to video editing and YouTube growth. You can track them, or keywords relating to YouTube growth, in your Hootsuite dashboard.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 5: Optimize your videos to get views</strong></h3>
<p>OK, let’s get specific about making you famous.</p>
<p>YouTube’s 2 billion users watch about 1 billion hours of video content every single day. So how do you rise above the noise and get YouTube’s algorithm to show your videos?</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with SEO and Google’s algorithm, YouTube works in a similar way with 1 key difference: Personalization.</p>
<p>When you search a phrase on Google, you’re served roughly the same website results as other people. I say “roughly,” because some results change based on location.</p>
<p>But if you and a buddy sat next to each other in the same room, on the same Wi-Fi and searched for the same keyword, you’d see the same results.</p>
<p>Not the case on YouTube.</p>
<p>When YouTube shows you search results, they take into account the keyword and similar things Google looks for: How popular a video already is, keywords in the title, etc. But YouTube also factors in your watch history and the types of videos it knows you like to watch.</p>
<p>That’s why no two users’ YouTube homepage or search results will be 100% alike.</p>
<p>Personalization plays a role, but it’s still important to do all those other YouTube <em>SEO things</em> to get your videos found in search.</p>
<p>Here are the 6 ways you need to optimize your videos to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/get-views-youtube/">get more views</a>:</p>
<h4>Do keyword research</h4>
<p>Before you can optimize your video, you need to know what you’re optimizing for. Keyword research gives you the phrases people are using to find content so you can add it to yours, too. (More on this in a sec.)</p>
<p>You can use Google Keyword Planner for <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/google-ads/#How_to_use_Google_Keyword_Planner_for_your_ads">keyword research</a>. Additionally, type your topic into the YouTube search bar and see what comes up. These are all things real people have searched for. This can give you ideas for new keywords.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302629" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-8-620x536.jpg" alt="YouTube growth keyword search" width="620" height="536" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-8-620x536.jpg 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-8-310x268.jpg 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-8-768x664.jpg 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing-8.jpg 1172w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<h4>Add your keywords to your video</h4>
<p>You should have one main keyword and a few additional ones for each video. Here’s where to add them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video title (main keyword)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-descriptions/#17_tips_for_writing_YouTube_descriptions">video description</a> (main keyword + 1-2 related keywords)
<ul>
<li>Use the main keyword within the first 3 sentences</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The video’s tags
<ul>
<li>According to YouTube, this has minimal impact, but use your <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/146402?hl=en">keywords as tags</a> anyway. It only takes a second.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use timestamps</h4>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9884579?hl=en">YouTube timestamps</a> are like breaking your video into chapters. It allows viewers to skip around to the sections they’re most interested in. This increases the chance they’ll watch more of your video.</p>
<p>Take a look at how the Hootsuite team uses timestamps to help their audience navigate longer videos.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing9.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302645" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing9-620x723.png" alt="How to Use Hootsuite in 13 Minutes YouTube video with timestamps" width="620" height="723" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing9-620x723.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing9-310x361.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing9-768x895.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing9-1318x1536.png 1318w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing9.png 1649w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<h4>Create a detailed video description</h4>
<p>Each <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-descriptions/#17_tips_for_writing_YouTube_descriptions">video’s description</a> should have a unique section of a few sentences describing what it’s about. But, you can create <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2660027">default descriptions</a> to save time for the parts you want in every video.</p>
<p>Here’s what you want to include in your description:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website link</li>
<li>Links to your other social media accounts</li>
<li>Links to your products or services mentioned in the video</li>
<li>A call to action</li>
</ul>
<h4>Create an engaging video thumbnail</h4>
<p>Custom thumbnails are so important for views. Besides your title, it’s the only other thing users have to decide if they want to watch your video or not.</p>
<p>What counts as a good <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel/">YouTube thumbnail</a> will vary depending on your audience. As a minimum, make sure it isn’t just a screenshot from your video. Use a photo or your brand elements and add some text to lure viewers in — like Hootsuite does on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HootsuiteLabs/videos">Hootsuite Labs channel</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hootsuite-labs-thumbnails.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302557" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hootsuite-labs-thumbnails-620x126.png" alt="Hootsuite labs thumbnails" width="620" height="126" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hootsuite-labs-thumbnails-620x126.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hootsuite-labs-thumbnails-310x63.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hootsuite-labs-thumbnails-768x156.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hootsuite-labs-thumbnails-1536x312.png 1536w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hootsuite-labs-thumbnails-2048x416.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>Current specs are a 16:9 format with a minimum size of ​​1280 x 720 pixels.</p>
<h4>Respond to comments</h4>
<p>YouTube is a social network, right? So act like it. Responding to viewer comments shows you’re there to build a community, not to push out self-promotional content.</p>
<p>It also boosts your video&#8217;s status to the algorithm because more comments = more popular-seeming video.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 6: Upload and schedule your videos</strong></h3>
<p>This is it, you’re ready to go.</p>
<p>You can upload your finished video directly into YouTube Studio and either publish it right away or schedule it for later. You can also <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-schedule-youtube-videos/">schedule videos with Hootsuite</a> the same way you schedule all your other social content.</p>
<p>For scheduling, a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often are you going to post? Pick a schedule — daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc — and stick to it.</li>
<li>Think about the best day to post on for your audience. When are they most likely to watch your content?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 7: Optimize your channel to attract followers</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve talked about optimizing individual videos but you also need to optimize your entire channel. Make sure your <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-channel-art-templates/">channel art</a> and profile photo reflect your branding.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing10.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302653" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing10-620x321.png" alt="Hootsuite channel art visual branding" width="620" height="321" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing10-620x321.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing10-310x160.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing10-768x397.png 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing10.png 1175w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to visual branding, YouTube has some built-in features that make it easier to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-get-free-youtube-subscribers/">get more subscribers</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group your videos into playlists organized by topic.</li>
<li>Create a channel trailer, which is like a commercial representing what your channel is about.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know when you’re watching a video and the creator always tells people to “like and subscribe?” There’s a reason: It works.</p>
<p>In your videos, be sure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask people to subscribe to your channel and like, comment and/or share your video.</li>
<li>Have a clear call to action.</li>
<li>Engage with your audience.
<ul>
<li>For example, mention how audience questions inspired the current video.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a custom end screen to direct viewers to other videos of yours to keep them on your channel longer.</li>
<li>Add closed captioning. You should prioritize accessibility in all your content, and captions include Deaf and/or hard-of-hearing people in your potential audience.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/captions#strategies-zippy-link-3">Uploading your own captions</a> will ensure accuracy and is something you can easily outsource.</li>
<li>YouTube also offers free, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en">automatic captioning</a> but it often gets words wrong.</li>
<li>You can even add translated versions of your captions to better serve a multilingual audience or earn more international views.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 8: Try YouTube advertising</strong></h3>
<p>Not growing fast enough? Try <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-advertising/">YouTube ads</a>.</p>
<p>Most YouTube ads are videos but you can also place banner ads, either in videos or on the website. You can also make your video ads either skippable after 5 seconds, or unskippable.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing11.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302661" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing11-620x276.png" alt="monday.com banner ads" width="620" height="276" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing11-620x276.png 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing11-310x138.png 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing11.png 629w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>As a Google company, YouTube ads operate through the Google Ads platform. Running successful ads requires a strategy of its own, which we detail in our <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/google-ads/">guide to Google Ads</a>.</p>
<p>Besides the campaign strategy, before you try out paid ads, make sure you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rock-solid understanding of who your audience is.</li>
<li>Optimized your YouTube channel’s visual branding and description.</li>
<li>Uploaded at least 5-10 videos so your new visitors can get a sense for what you’re all about.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 9: Try influencer marketing</strong></h3>
<p>YouTube influencers — called “creators” — are growing every year. YouTube reported a <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-stats-marketers/">50% year over year growth</a> in the number of creators earning over $10,000 per year, and a 40% increase in those earning over $100,000.</p>
<p>While new social platforms pop up all the time and become the “hot” place to advertise, like TikTok in 2021, YouTube is a high-performing channel for brands. Almost half of all brands who plan to use <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/influencer-marketing/#Types_of_social_media_influencers">influencer marketing</a> will use YouTube.</p>
<figure id="attachment_302669" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-302669" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing12.webp"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-302669 size-full" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing12.webp" alt="graph of social media platforms that US marketers plan to use for influencer marketing" width="470" height="386" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing12.webp 470w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing12-310x255.webp 310w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-302669" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/chart/246776/which-social-media-platforms-us-marketers-planning-use-influencer-marketing-of-respondents-dec-2019-vs-march-2021">eMarketer</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube is a classic sponsorship channel for a reason: <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-stats-marketers/">70% of viewers</a> have bought a product they saw featured on YouTube.</p>
<p>As with any form of paid advertising or marketing campaign, you can’t jump straight into an influencer partnership without some prep work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your audience, know <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/smart-social-media-goals/">your goals</a>… you know this part already.</li>
<li>Play by the rules  — and not just YouTube’s rules. Follow <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking">FTC rules</a> for disclosing paid or sponsored content. Ensure your creator partner uses the hashtags #ad or #sponsored, as a minimum.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-find-instagram-influencers/">Choose an influencer</a> who aligns with your brand and who you trust to produce high-quality content.</li>
<li>Analyze your results after the campaign and learn what to do differently next time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nike’s campaign with “What’s Inside?” shows what’s possible when you let your creator take the lead. Famous for cutting everyday items in half to see what’s inside, the aptly-named channel created a series of videos for Nike to promote a new shoe.</p>
<p>The most popular video of the series is where they cut the new shoe in half, which earned over 7.1 million views.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What&#039;s inside Nike Air VaporMax?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DbCHxSF67mA?list=PL3BVMyyYBBRE58ImwDliKMyqwrdSGLPyu" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3><strong>Step 10: Analyze and adapt</strong></h3>
<p>As with all marketing, you need to track your <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/">YouTube analytics</a> at least monthly. Use YouTube’s built-in reports to see what your audience is watching, what they like the most, where your traffic is coming from and more.</p>
<p>Use analytics to track your channel growth, too. Write down your numbers monthly for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscribers</li>
<li>Views</li>
<li>View duration</li>
<li>Top videos</li>
<li>Watch time</li>
<li>Impressions</li>
<li>Your click-through rate (CTR)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing13.webp"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-302677" src="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing13-620x353.webp" alt="channel analytics overview" width="620" height="353" srcset="https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing13-620x353.webp 620w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing13-310x177.webp 310w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing13-768x438.webp 768w, https://blog.hootsuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-marketing13.webp 970w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>This becomes your benchmark to measure your channel by each month. Not growing? Then it’s time to adjust your YouTube marketing strategy.</p>
